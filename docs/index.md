### Assessment
You can try to answer the following questions and see where you sit on this.


<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   How do you find all the database schemas, message queues and assets a team has?

-   Are resources like repository, schema, topics provisioned through ticketing by special admins?

-   Do you calculate impact prior to software release and exercise different levels of testing with various integration points?

-   Do you know what configuration a given microservice is running, who the owner is and how quickly the owner is contacted when problems occur?

If you did not confidently answer the above questions' answers to yourself, there may be a good chance Ops Catalog could help with your DevOps workflows.
