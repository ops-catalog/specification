# Why Ops Catalog

<span class="highlight">Just as you wouldn't navigate a book without an index, you can't steer a sizable business effectively without an Ops Catalog.</span>

### The Challenge: Scattered Knowledge and Manual Drudgery

In many organizations, information about infrastructure, APIs, services, and ownership resides in disparate silos‚Äîspreadsheets, wikis, even tribal knowledge.  Developers waste countless hours searching for what they need, contacting other teams for basic information, and manually provisioning resources. These friction points create frustration, delays, and potential misconfigurations.

### The Ops Catalog Solution: A Central Source of Truth

An Ops Catalog system establishes a centralized, API-driven repository of information about all the components that make up an organization's technology stack. Key features drive value:

- Automated Discovery: Specialized modules continually discover and update information about infrastructure, APIs, microservices, databases‚Äîall the building blocks developers rely on.
- Standardized Specification: Data adheres to a clear format, making it easily understandable and usable, both by humans and machines.
- API-Driven: The API unlocks automation, letting developers integrate Ops Catalog data and workflows into their existing tools and CI/CD pipelines
The Transformation
- Automated Provisioning: Actions are taken when new resource requests are added to the catalog which promotes a scalable approach to providing self-service capability without manual toil.

### Process
- From Searching to Finding: Developers no longer spend hours hunting for obscure details. The Ops Catalog delivers accurate data in seconds.
- Self-Service Empowerment: With ready access to resource descriptions and potential automation for provisioning, developers can independently experiment, test, and deploy new solutions.
- Knowledge Sharing and Collaboration: The Ops Catalog encourages teams to document their components and ownership. This fosters transparency and cross-team understanding.
