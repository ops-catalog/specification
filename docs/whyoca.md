# Why Ops Catalog

> Just as you wouldn't navigate a book without an index, you can't steer a sizable business effectively without an Ops Catalog.

!!! warning "The Challenge: Scattered Knowledge and Manual Drudgery"
    In many organizations, information about infrastructure, APIs, services, and ownership resides in disparate silosâ€”spreadsheets, wikis, even tribal knowledge.  Developers waste countless hours searching for what they need, contacting other teams for basic information, and manually provisioning resources. These friction points create frustration, delays, and potential misconfigurations.

        B --> F[Other Teams]

        F --> G
    ```

    An Ops Catalog system establishes a centralized, API-driven repository of information about all the components that make up an organization's technology stack. Key features drive value:

    - Automated Discovery :material-magnify:: Specialized modules continually discover and update information about infrastructure, APIs, microservices, databasesâ€”all the building blocks developers rely on.
    - Standardized Specification :material-format-list-checks:: Data adheres to a clear format, making it easily understandable and usable, both by humans and machines.
    - API-Driven :material-api:: The API unlocks automation, letting developers integrate Ops Catalog data and workflows into their existing tools and CI/CD pipelines.
    - Automated Provisioning :material-cogs:: Actions are taken when new resource requests are added to the catalog which promotes a scalable approach to providing self-service capability without manual toil.
